											</header>
											<p>Just as the Amish today use member’s houses for services, the early Mennonites used the Herr home and barn for their own gatherings. Though for many, this house may look plain and small, complete with simple details and diminutive windows, for the Germans who came over, building in stone was a sign of achievement in status. Those who came to Pennsylvania from Germany and Switzerland were likely living in wood homes before they emigrated.</p>

											<p>Many communal societies, Pietist sects, or separatist groups had father figures or leaders who developed their faith, led them to their settlements, and acted as spiritual guides during their formation. The Shakers had Elder[s] James Whittaker, Joseph Meacham, and Frederick Evans, while the Perfectionists at Oneida had John Humphrey Noyes. Likewise, the Moravians turned to Count Nicholas Ludwig von Zinzendorf and the Harmonists to George Rapp.</p>

												<h3>Theophilus Gates</h3>
											</header>
											<p>Around the end of the Second Great Awakening, a radical religious group took hold in North and South Coventry townships, Chester County, Pennsylvania. At the time, this group would shock residents of this sleepy region outside Pottstown, but they have long been forgotten or romanticised. Driving along the back roads, you pass numerous cemeteries and small churches that seem ordinary and unassuming, but two religious communities only ten miles or so apart share a history that is rooted in free love, perfectionism and the various millenarium sects that rose out of this period’s religious revivals.</p>

												<h3>Hagley Museum and Library</h3>

											<p>Hagley was described in an 1813 document as "Hagley an Estate," and it had been called Hagley at least as early as 1797, when its owner (Philadelphia Quaker merchant Rumford Dawes) applied for insurance on buildings at "a place called Hagley situated on Brandywine Creek." Dawes had acquired the property in 1783. Since the name Hagley did not appear on the documents transferring ownership at that time, it seems likely that it was Dawes who gave the name to the Brandywine location.</p>

Fulton nurtured his early artistic talents by painting tavern and shopkeeper signs, as well as etching and engraving firearms for Isch and Messersmith Gunsmiths. Since Lancaster became a supply center for the Continental Army, American soldiers were a constant presence, and this closeness to muskets and cannons laid the foundation for Fulton’s later interest with the weapons of war and instruments of explosion.</p>

Read consulted leading Philadelphia horticulturists, including Bernard McMahon and David Landreth, about installing a garden with ornamental qualities on his property; however, surviving evidence suggests he maintained little more than a kitchen garden.</p>
