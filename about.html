												<h3>What is material culture?</h3>
											</header>
											<p>Material Culture refers to objects created and used by a society that influences and defines its culture. Studying material objects provides context for the lifestyle, culture, and knowledge possessed within a specific point in time. From architecture, to tools, to clothing, material culture provides clues for understanding the past and how it may have influnced, and continues to influence, our present.</p>

                                    <p><span class="image right"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lmp2055/finalimages/master/images/headshot.JPG" alt="" /></span> Growing up in Lehigh Valley region of Pennsylvania,          Christopher Malone developed a passion for history and an appreciation  for the rich cultural heritage found amongst the art, architecture, and folk customs of Pennsylvania’s Hinterland. After studying Architectural Studies and Film at the University of Pittsburgh, he began to explore museums and historic sites each weekend, researching and comparing their histories, styles, and structures within the greater cultural narrative.Between 2011-2015, Christopher completed a Masters in Architecture at Syracuse University where his third-year studio project was featured in Beyond Ground: Urban Visions for London at London’s Centre for the Built Environment. His thesis focused on architecture’s representation in film and the digital world with an emphasis on spatial voyeurism. Frequent trips to antique shops fostered his understanding and admiration of the material life of the past resulting in his burgeoning photography and folk art collections.</p> 
								    <p>To synthesize his studies and interests, he began writing The Daily Antiquarian, a blog focusing on the history, architecture, and material culture of the Mid-Atlantic. While volunteering at the Philadelphia History Museum, Christopher began working at the Moravian Historical Society, eventually becoming the Operations Manager. Under his tenure, the society saw a renewed focus on its important collection by highlighting stories and local history through social media. In addition, Christopher volunteered in the collections department at Lehigh University’s Art Galleries, photographing objects and identifying key themes and time periods amongst their collection of 19th and 20th century images. While at Winterthur, he looks forward to studying how objects and architecture relate to cultural and religious ideas of representation amid folk and fine art traditions.</p>
