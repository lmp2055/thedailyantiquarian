Its cupola is like that on the Court House in Lancaster. There were subsequent additions to the building after it was first built. In 1790 an adjoining office building was constructed. In 1792 a gallery was built in the court room, and in 1796 the interior was completed as a formal court room. In 1814 two additional gables and a large clock tower were added.After meeting one day at Lancaster, Congress moved to York so that the Susquehanna River would be between it and the enemy. It was at York from September 30, 1777, until June 27, 1778. While there, Congress met at the York County Court House.</p>
                                        
								    <p><span class="image right"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lmp2055/finalimages/master/images/courthouse2.jpg" alt="" /></span>In 1838 construction on a new and larger Court House on a new site was begun, and the old Court House was demolished in 1841. The York County Bicentennial Commission reconstructed the old Court House in time for the 1977-78 celebration of the 200th Anniversary of the meeting of the Congress in York.It was while the Congress was at York that it passed the Articles of Confederation, although they were not to become effective until ratified by the various states. It was also while the Congress was at York that a treaty of Alliance was signed on February 6, 1778, with the French. Three months later a committee of the Congress began to prepare instructions to American commissioners at foreign courts.</p>
                                    
                                    <p>This reconstructed colonial courthouse resides in York, York County, Pennsylvania.
