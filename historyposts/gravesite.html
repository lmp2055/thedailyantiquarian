										<h1>Theophilus Gates and His Free Love Valley</h1>

                                    <p><span class="image left"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lmp2055/finalimages/master/images/gravesitee1.jpg" alt="" /></span>Around the end of the Second Great Awakening, a radical religious group took hold in North and South Coventry townships, Chester County, Pennsylvania. At the time, this group would shock residents of this sleepy region outside Pottstown, but they have long been forgotten or romanticised. Driving along the back roads, you pass numerous cemeteries and small churches that seem ordinary and unassuming, but two religious communities only ten miles or so apart share a history that is rooted in free love, perfectionism and the various millenarium sects that rose out of this period’s religious revivals.</p>
                                    
                                    <p>Theophilus Ransom Gates was born in Hartland, Connecticut to a family that went generations back in colonial American history. Described as a “sickly” child, Gates grew up one of many children raised by his parents Theophilus Lord Gates and Dorothy Ransom. Bookish at best, Gates made his way into teaching but would eventually turn to itinerant preaching throughout the north and south. In 1810, Gates published, The Trials, Experiences, Exercises of Mind and First Travels of Theophilus R. Gates. With this and subsequent publications, Gates lamented at the state of the world and the evil being preached from religious schools and seminaries. By combining two of his publications, The Reformer, and The Christian, into The Reformer and Christian, Gates began to comment on the changing tide that he saw the world experiencing, a tide that would bring about the thousand year millennium predicted in the Book of Revelations. While Gates was in Philadelphia distributing his pamphlets, another man was pondering the second coming just outside Syracuse in a little town named Oneida.</p>
                                    
								    <p><span class="image right"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lmp2055/finalimages/master/images/gravesitee2.jpg" alt="" /></span>John Humphrey Noyes, together with his followers called Perfectionists, thought that the second coming had already occurred around the year 70, and that because of this, he was without sin. Thus being without sin allowed him to become more and more perfect and eventually attain perfection on earth. Noyes began a newspaper in New Haven, Connecticut called the Perfectionist. Gates was an early contributor to this paper and used his own writings against Noyes. In 1835, Noyes traveled to Philadelphia to visit Gates. Here, Noyes confronted Gates about his writings and found him to be nervous, unhinged, and unconsolable. Gates thought Noyes as perverse and ordered him to leave. On January 15, 1837, Noyes wrote a letter to many of his regular contacts professing his doctrine of “complex marriage,” which held that men and women were above the laws of the earth because the second coming had already occurred. This included the sacrament of marriage, which Noyes deemed incompatible with Perfectionism. In a move that would backfire on him, Noyes sent this letter to Gates who published it out of spite.</p>
                                    
                                    <h3>The letter reads:</h3>
				                    <div class="box">
								    <i><p>"Dear Brother,--'Though the vision tarry long, wait for it--it will come. I need not tell you why I have delayed writing so long, and why I am in the same circumstances as when we were together--I thank God that I have the same confidence for you as myself--I have fully discerned the beauty and drank the spirit of Habakkuk's resolution; 'Although the fig tree shall not blossom, neither shall fruit be in the vines; the labour of the olive shall fail, and the fields shall yield no meat; the flock shall be cut off from the fold, and there shall be no herd in the stalls: yet I will rejoice in the Lord, I will joy in the God of my salvation.' Yea, brother I will rejoice in the Lord. Though he slay me, yet will I trust in him. The present winter is doubtless a time of sore tribulation to many. I see the saints laying off and on like the distressed ships at the entrance of New York Harbour, waiting for pilots, and I would advise them all, if I could, to make a bold push and 'run in' at all events. For one I have passed the Hook--my soul is moored with an anchor sure and steadfast--the anchor of Hope, and I am willing to do what I can as a pilot to others--yea, I will lay down my life for the brethren. </p>
                                    <p>As necessity is the mother of invention--so is the mother of faith. I therefore rejoice in the necessity which will ere long, work full confidence in God--such confidence as will permit him to save his people in 'a way they have not known.' In the meantime, my faith is growing exceedingly. I know that the things of which we communed at Newhaven, will be accomplished. Of the times and seasons I know nothing. During my residence at Newark, my heart and mind were greatly enlarged. I have full leisure to investigate the prophecies, and came to many conclusions of like importance to those which interested us at New Haven. The substance of all is, that God is about to set a throne on his footstool, and heaven and earth, i.e. all spiritual and political dynasties will flee away from the face of him that shall sit thereon. The righteous will be separated from the wicked by the opening of the books and the testimony of the saints. 'The house of Jacob shall be a fire, and the house of Joseph a flame, and the house of Esau for stubble. </p>
                                    <p>Survivors shall come upon mount Zion to judge the mount of Esau; and the kingdom shall be the Lord's.' Obadiah 18, 21. Between this present time, and the establishment of God's kingdom over the earth, lies a chaos of confusion, tribulation, woe, &c. such as must attend the destruction of the fashion of this world, and the introduction of the will of God as it is done in heaven. For the present, a long race and a hard warfare is before the saints, i.e. an opportunity and demand for faith- -one of the most precious commodities of heaven. Only let us lay fast hold of the hope of our calling - let us set the Lord and his glory always before our face, and we shall not be moved. I thank God that you 'have fully known my manor of life - faith - purpose - afflictions' to the end that you may rest in the day of trouble--for I say to you before God, that though I be weak in Christ, I know that I shall live by the power of God toward you and all saints. I am holden up by the strength that is needed to sustain not my weight only, but the weight of all who shall come after me.</p>
                                    <p>I will write all that is in my heart on one delicate subject, and you may judge for yourself whether it is expedient to show this letter to others when the will of God is done on earth, as it is in heaven, there will be no marriage. The marriage supper of the Lamb, is a feast at which every dish is free to every guest. Exclusiveness, jealousy, quarrelling, have no place there, for the same reason as that which forbids the guests at a thanksgiving dinner to claim each his separate dish, and quarrel with the rest for his rights. In a holy community, there is no more reason why sexual intercourse should be restrained by law, than why eating and drinking should be--and there is as little occasion for shame in the one case as in the other. God has placed a wall of partition between the male and female during the Apostacy, for good reasons, which will be broken down in the resurrection for equally good reasons. But woe to him who abolished the law of the Apostacy before he stands in the holiness of the resurrection. The guests of the marriage supper may have each his favourite dish, each a dish of his own procuring, and that without the jealousy of exclusiveness. I call a certain woman my wife--she is yours, she is Christ's, and in him she is the bride of all saints. She is dear in the hand of a stranger and according to my promise to her I rejoice. My claim upon her cuts directly across the marriage covenant of this world, and God knows the end. Write if you wish to hear from me.</p>
                                        <p>Your's in the Lord."</p></i>

                                    <p><span class="image left"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lmp2055/finalimages/master/images/gravesitee3.jpg" alt="" /></span>In June of 1837, Gates published Battle Axe and Weapons of War, Vol. I, No. 1, a title which he combed from the book of Jeremiah. In it, Gates declared marriage between men and women to be null and void because it only allowed for differences that were sure to come between them to remain so because of the bond they made together. He described marriage as a fight between a cat and a dog where one bites the other but out of tradition must stay together. Battle Axe and Weapons of War would see three publications, a final one in December of that year and a second volume in July, in which Gates used the letter Noyes sent him, opening up Noyes’ theology for derision among those who bought copies. Noyes publicly owned up to being the author of the scandalous letter. Gates had taken what Noyes believed farther than Noyes himself would dare to go: free love, unrestrained by communes or structure, no rules except the knowledge that God was in the details and he alone controlled Gates’ conception of morality. </p>
                                    <p>Gates would find an ally in Hannah Williamson, a young woman whom he met in Philadelphia, whose family owned a farm in rural Chester County. Gates and Williamson would cull together a small group of followers who practiced free love and chose “spouses” for a day or even a lifetime. Some of these followers include William Stubblebine, George and Samuel Rinehart, and Magdelena Snyder. Together they practiced “free love” in each other's households, abandoning all earthly laws and clothing, for Adam and Eve were perfect in the garden of Eden and did not require garments to cover themselves before they ate of the tree of knowledge. It was said that they plowed their fields and sowed their crops as if they were living in Eden, and often danced around wildly, unsympathetic to their neighbors' condemnations. The Rev. John C. Guldin of Shenkel Church regularly preached against them, which was answered with a much cited account of the group parading down the church aisles in the nude. </p>
                                    <p>On November 6, 1846, the Public Ledger in Philadelphia announced that Theophilus Ransom Gates had died, much to the chagrin of his followers who expected heaven on earth to miraculously appear before them. No such event occurred and Gates was buried in Union Cemetery at Parkerford where the epitaph on his tombstone reads,</p>
                                    
                                       <p> “Happy soul, thy days are ended, <br />
                                        All thy mourning days below,<br />
                                        Go, by angel guards attended,<br />
                                        To the sight of Jesus go.<br />
                                        Waiting to receive thy spirit,<br />
                                        Lo, the Saviour stands above,<br />
                                        Shows the purchase of his merit,<br />
                                        Reaches out the crown of love.”</p>
                                    
                                    <p>Hannah Wiliamson would live with Daniel and David Stubblebine after Gates’ death, extending the Battle-Axe’s life a few more years until about 1857, when she supposedly moved west after numerous bouts with Chester County law enforcement, who saw the Battle-Axes as an immoral sect who needed to leave the “God-fearing” people of Coventry and never return. </p>
