                                    <p>This house stopped me in my tracks. I had to park on the road, get out and grab as many shots as I could in the deluge that was Tropical Storm Fay, but very glad I did!</p>

                                    <p><i>In 1753, a team of workers from outside the Valley built the house that is on the property today. Located in Pike Township, the two stone structures on this site are excellent examples of 18th century German-influenced architecture. The larger house was built for Jacob and Magdalena Keim around 1753 and was inhabited by their descendants until 1911. It is a 2 ½-story limestone structure. The building originally had a red clay tile roof, but currently is covered by a standing metal seam roof. The walk-in fireplaces and much of the woodwork and hardware are intact. The foundation and walls are made of native limestone. It is a stove-room house with facades that have a balanced look and interiors illuminated by many windows. A stove-room house has a three-room first floor plan which includes a kitchen on one side of a centrally located fireplace, and a “stove” room or family space, and a bedroom on the opposite side of this fireplace. The central stone chimney is capped by a brick section which protrudes the roof line. The original house block has segmented arches over all exterior openings.
                                    </i></p>
									<p><i>The Keims are descendant from Johannes Keim who came from Lindau, Bavaria around 1698. Keim was born in Speier, Germany in 1675. Keim left Germany after the French invasion of the Palatinate (1688-1697) which ruined him. Johannes immigrated through the port of Philadelphia. After staking out his claim in the Oley Valley, Johannes returned to Germany where he married his first wife, Katarina, in 1706.</i> <br />—<a href="http://www.historicpreservationtrust.org/">Historic Preservation Trust of Berks County</a>
