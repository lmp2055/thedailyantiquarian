The Shakers had Elder[s] James Whittaker, Joseph Meacham, and Frederick Evans, while the Perfectionists at Oneida had John Humphrey Noyes. Likewise, the Moravians turned to Count Nicholas Ludwig von Zinzendorf and the Harmonists to George Rapp.</p>
                                    
                                    <h3>A Count and his Unity</h3>

                                    <p>Count Nicholas Ludwig von Zinzendorf was born in Dresden on May 26, 1700. A noble by birth, Zinzendorf was raised by his grandmother, the Baroness Gersdorf, a pious women who surrounded the young count with other figures who formed the Pietist movement that gained hold in many towns and villages throughout Europe. Zinzendorf was sent to the pedagogium at Halle and trained under the pietist, August Herman Franke. Here, Zinzendorf would learn and develop his passion for the Protestant faith and and here is where he would gain the inspiration he used to revive the Renewed Moravian Church. Zinzendorf wrote the Brotherly Agreement in 1727 for the persecuted refugees that took up residence on his estate. Along with Zinzendorf, these people began the little hamlet of Herrnhut, where they lived and worshipped together. </p>
								    <p>Having been exiled from his estate for 10 years, Zinzendorf used that time to grow the church in England and in the Americas. From this mustard seed, grew the Unitas Fratrum that we know today as the Moravian Church. It’s curious to note that many of the most important Moravian leaders referred to Zinzendorf in their letters as “Lieben Papa” or “Papagen,” affectionately calling him Father or “Little Papa” (the Moravians used diminutives for the many names they called each other). To many, he was the father of the Church on earth, while Christ was the “Lambkin” or Heiland. Zinzendorf had planned to partially reside in the American colonies but ill-health and his death in 1760 prevented this from happening. Today he is remembered for his theology, songs, hymns and for renewing the Moravian faith which traces its roots to the 15th century martyr Jan Hus and education reformer Jan Amos Comenius.</p>
                                    
                                    <h3>Johann Georg Rapp and his Harmonists</h3>

                                    <p><span class="image right"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lmp2055/finalimages/master/images/fathers2.jpg" alt="" /></span>Johann Georg Rapp was born on November 1, 1757 in Iptingen, a small village northwest of Stuttgart. A weaver by trade, he and his wife Christina Benzinger officially broke with the local Protestant Church in 1785 after weeks of being absent from services. Rapp and some of his followers objected to Christian baptism, confirmation and communion claiming these rites lost all meaning, especially when performed on children. After many formal complaints against Rapp and his followers and after writing the group’s Articles of Faith in 1798, Rapp left for American in 1803. Rapp wanted to settle on land on Ohio, but eventually settled on the Connoquenessing Creek in Butler County, Pennsylvania in a town he called Harmony (Harmonie). The community adopted communalism, living and working together for the greater good. Around 1809, Rapp was accepted as the organizational head of the society. Members began to call him “Father” as Rapp began to hear confessions, give sermons and advise on every aspect of the community including agricultural and economic pursuits. </p>
                                    <p>Rapp interpreted some early nineteenth century events as signs of the second coming of Christ and thus the society went through a religious revival. Eventually Rapp would purchase property on the Wabash River in the Indiana territory where he and his followers began New Harmony. By 1818 Rapp and his family lived in a large mansion house which was much different than the communal dwellings society members inhabited. Rapp’s elevation as leader saw his status in the community become almost otherworldly. Between 1824-1826, the Harmonists moved to the village of Economy along the Ohio River ten miles north of Pittsburgh.</p>
                                    <p>Though the Harmony Society lasted seventy four years after a schism that happened in 1832, many of the community’s younger generations became disillusioned with communal life, celibacy and George Rapp’s almost prophet-like status amongst the Harmonist believers. George Rapp died on August 7, 1847 passing from this life never seeing the second coming or the many other millennial manifestations he thought would come to pass in the nineteenth century. Though their spiritual father died, the Harmonists turned to other figures for guidance including Jacob Henrici and R. L. Baker, but their tenures as Trustees didn’t last as long as Rapp’s leadership.</p>
