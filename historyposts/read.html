										<h1>Read House and Gardens</h1>

                                    <p><span class="image left"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lmp2055/finalimages/master/images/read2.png" alt="" /></span>Although the cornerstone for the foundation was laid in 1797, active construction of the house occurred between 1801 and 1803. Read consulted leading Philadelphia horticulturists, including Bernard McMahon and David Landreth, about installing a garden with ornamental qualities on his property; however, surviving evidence suggests he maintained little more than a kitchen garden.</p>
                                    <p>In 1824 a devastating fire claimed most of the buildings on the southern half of Front Street (The Strand). George Read II’s empty river lot stopped the fire on the river side of the street, and Wilmington fire companies servicing his home arrested the fire on the land side of the street. His father’s house next door, which George Read II rented to tenants in 1824, was claimed by the fire.</p>
                                    <p>William Couper, employed in the import/export trade, purchased the former home of George Read II in 1846. Having spent a period of his childhood in the former home of George Read I next door, Couper knew the Read House well. Couper, a bachelor, lived in the house with his mother, siblings, and their children.</p>

                                    <p><span class="image right"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lmp2055/finalimages/master/images/read4.png" alt="" /></span>In 1920, a Wilmington couple, Philip and Lydia Laird, purchased the mansion and property. Inside the house the Lairds installed electricity, central heat, and modern plumbing. They also introduced a series of taprooms in their basement for informally entertaining family and friends. Outside their yard included a swimming pool in the old kitchen garden and a yacht basin on the river. They erected a brick wall to enclose their garden, laid brick over original gravel garden paths, and replaced the house’s original front granite steps with marble.</p>
                                    <p>We must reiterate how much we were impressed with New Castle. It was such a lovely, historic, inviting town along the Delaware River, with attractive cobblestone streets, red brick buildings, quaint inns and coffeehouses, and for those Taphophiles out there, a least one or two old graveyards filled with history and charm.</p>
