                                    <h3>Middleport Pottery</h3>
                                    <p><span class="image left"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lmp2055/finalimages/master/images/middleport.png" alt="" /></span><b>While we <em>normally</em> only stick U.S. locations, we took a trip across the pond and saw a number of amazing historical attractions.</b> One was the listed Middleport Pottery, constructed in 1888 on a site next to the Trent and Mersey Canal for the firm of Burgess and Leigh. It was immediately recognised as a model for the pottery industry for its design, layout and workforce conditions. It's the last working Victorian pottery in the UK and survives in remarkably complete condition.</p>

                                    <p>The pottery still produces the internationally acclaimed ‘Burleigh’ ware, using much of the original machinery and processes. Unique to ‘Burleigh’ is the process of underglaze tissue printing, creating patterns using hand-engraved copper rollers.</p>

                                     <h3>Chapel, St. John's College, Oxford</h3>
                                    <p><span class="image right"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lmp2055/finalimages/master/images/oxford.png" alt="" /></span>The Chapel has been the focal point for Christian worship since before St John’s came into existence. It was originally consecrated in 1530 as the chapel of St Bernard’s College, the Cistercian house of study in Oxford, and re-dedicated to John the Baptist in 1557.

                                    <p>The Chapel as you see it today is largely the result of the reordering by Edward Blore in 1843, with subsequent alterations by Sir Edward Maufe in the 1930s. The chequerboard floor is said to date back to the Restoration period, but most other features are 19th century: the altar rails that William Laud installed were removed to the parish church in Northmoor, just west of Oxford, where they may still be seen, and the remains of the 17th-century screen are in Painswick House in Gloucestershire. Behind the altar is a wooden reredos by Charles Kempe made in 1892; Kempe also designed the east window, with figures including Sir Thomas White and Henry Chichele, founder of St Bernard’s College.</p>

                                    <h3>The Queen's House</h3>
                                    <p><span class="image left"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lmp2055/finalimages/master/images/greenwich.png" alt="" /></span>The famous English architect Inigo Jones designed the Queen’s House, inspired by his travels in Italy. It is widely known as the first Classical building in England. Inigo Jones used a lot of symmetry and proportion in his design, which is reflected in the perfect cube of the Great Hall. He also worked on the outfits for many of the masques that took place in the Queen's House</p>

                                    <h3>St. Mary Aldermary</h3>
                                    <p><span class="image right"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lmp2055/finalimages/master/images/stmary.png" alt="" /></span>The name St. Mary Aldermary indicates the ancient origins of the church. Aldermary, meaning “Older Mary”, implies this is the first local church dedicated to Mary and so it probably has Saxon roots. The earliest record is 11th century. After the Great Fire of 1666, the church was a “Gothic” rebuild. </p>

                                    <p>This went against the City authority’s plans but was possible due to a £5,000 legacy from Henry Rogers, a wealthy Somerset businessman, given for the “rebuilding of a church in London where there was most need”. The money was given to St. Mary Aldermary whose parishioners wanted the church rebuilt in the old style. This was overseen by John Oliver, one of Wren’s surveyors.</p>

                                    <h3>Hampton Court Palace</h3>
                                    <p><span class="image left"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lmp2055/finalimages/master/images/hampton.png" alt="" /></span>Always look up at Hampton Court Palace. The original Tudor palace was begun by Cardinal Wolsey in the early 16th century, but it soon attracted the attention of Henry VIII, who brought all his six wives here. Surrounded by gorgeous gardens and famous features such as the Maze and the Great Vine, the palace has been the setting for many nationally important events.</p>

                                    <p><span class="image right"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lmp2055/finalimages/master/images/hampton2.png" alt="" /></span>When William III and Mary II (1689-1702) took the throne in 1689, they commissioned Sir Christopher Wren to build an elegant new baroque palace. Later, Georgian kings and princes occupied the splendid interiors. When the royals left in 1737, impoverished ‘grace and favour’ aristocrats moved in.</p>
