Meetings were held in a private homes until 1688 when a log-structured meeting house was built on land donated by Nicholas Waln. Waln, Henry Paxton and James Dilworth were appointed trustees of the property. The final structure was not completed until 1689 when Thomas Stackhouse, builder, was asked to complete construction before the winter began. Another meetinghouse was constructed in 1718 after this one proved to be too small for the burgeoning Society of Friends. Again added to in 1763, we don’t see the present structure until 1793 when the second meetinghouse was replaced with the current 72x36 stone structure.</p>

                                    <p><span class="image right"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lmp2055/finalimages/master/images/middletown2.png" alt="" /></span>A distinctive feature of the building are the flat brownstone jack arches above the window openings. Often referred to as keystone arches, these “arches” are made of a darker, softer, brown sandstone than the remainder of the walls. The stone was chosen because the voussoirs which make up the flat arch had to be cut to the proper shape. Like many other architectural elements, arches above openings were first used to distribute the weight over the opening. In this case, the arches are more aesthetic than functional. The effect of the arches is so to highlight the windows in a restrained manner. The keystones are not enlarged or pronounced as they are on many similar arches found on other buildings during this period. High on the easterly gable end within this large triangle is a stone, which proudly proclaims 1793 as the date of the building’s construction. Close examination reveals a window, which was filled in below the date stone and above the cornice. Both the meetinghouse and school were used as a hospital during the Battle of Trenton. <p><i>Middletown Friends Meetinghouse, c. 1793, Newtown, Bucks County, Pennsylvania.</i></p>
