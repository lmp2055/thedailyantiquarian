Hagley was described in an 1813 document as "Hagley an Estate," and it had been called Hagley at least as early as 1797, when its owner (Philadelphia Quaker merchant Rumford Dawes) applied for insurance on buildings at "a place called Hagley situated on Brandywine Creek." Dawes had acquired the property in 1783. Since the name Hagley did not appear on the documents transferring ownership at that time, it seems likely that it was Dawes who gave the name to the Brandywine location.</p>
                                    
                                    <p><span class="image right"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lmp2055/finalimages/master/images/hagley2.png" alt="" /></span>In 1783 the site included (near the bottom of what we call Blacksmith Hill today) a water-powered slitting mill to produce cut nails. The next year Rumford Dawes constructed an eight-room, two-story dwelling, along with an adjoining kitchen and a flour mill, all of stone. He used the estate as a rural retreat, as well as a milling site. The principal house, Dawes wrote Stephen Girard in 1808 from Hagley, had "a Piazza fronting on the Brandywine, that has . . . a fine flow of water affording an agreeable murmur."</p>
