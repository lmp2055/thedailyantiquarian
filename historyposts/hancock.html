                           <h3>The Brick Dwelling Houses</h3>
                                    <p><span class="image left"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lmp2055/finalimages/master/images/brickdwelling.png" alt="" /></span>One of my favorite images from the Hancock Shaker visit. The Brick Dwelling houses the largest portion of the Village’s collection of Shaker furniture and other artifacts, as well as the efficient built-in cupboards, drawers, and peg rails. Rooms available for viewing include sleeping quarters, dining rooms, state-of-the-art kitchen, food storage rooms, meeting room, and other room settings illustrating aspects of Shaker daily life circa 1840-1850.
                            <h3>The Horse Barn</h3>
                                    <p><span class="image right"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lmp2055/finalimages/master/images/horsebarn.png" alt="" /></span>The Horse Barn originally stood on a nearby lot owned by the Shakers. It was dismantled and re-erected on this spot beginning on May 8th, 1850 by non-Shaker Matthew Criteden; and was completed by October of that year. An old wagon house (no longer extant) was moved across Route 20 to stand adjacent to it.</p>
                            <h3>The Round Stone Barn</h3>
                                    <p><span class="image left"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lmp2055/finalimages/master/images/roundbarn.png" alt="" /></span>Wagons entered on the upper level to deposit hay into the central haymow on the main floor below. The Brethren would drive the empty wagons around the circular barn floor and exit the same door they came in, eliminating the potentially dangerous activity of backing wagons out of a barn. The cows stabled on the main floor faced inward toward the haymow for ease of feeding. Manure shoveled through trapdoors to the cellar was stored until needed as fertilizer in the gardens. The Shakers maintained a working dairy farm at Hancock into the 1950s.</p>

                                    <h3>Inside the Shaker Home</h3>
                                    <p><span class="image right"><img src="../images/insideshaker.png" alt="" /></span>The Shakers utilized hired labor as early as 1826 when stone masons were brought in to build the Round Stone Barn. As Shaker membership declined in the second half of the nineteenth century, especially in the Brethren’s order, farm workers were hired to keep lands in production and perform heavy labor. Hired men were lodged in a separate building, convenient to the Trustee’s Office, where they received their daily work assignments and ate their meals. 
                            <h3>The Wash Room</h3>
                                    <p><span class="image left"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lmp2055/finalimages/master/images/insideshaker.png" alt="" /></span>The laundry wash room floor is covered with marble slabs, which slope up at the edges of the walls. A brick stove is built onto the south end of the large fireplace, which is faced with marble slabs. A circular stone base near the east wall marks the location of an early washing machine, operated by the overhead shafts and wheels. There is an ironing room. A central stairway leads to the second story, where wooden drying racks hang from exposed framing, and there are also stairs to the attic.</p>
                                <h3>The Laundry and Machine Shop</h3>
                                    <p><span class="image right"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lmp2055/finalimages/master/images/laundryshop.png" alt="" /></span>Housing both Brethren’s and Sisters’ work under one roof was rare throughout Shaker history due to their belief in gender separation. Machines and equipment in the building ran on a state-of-the-art waterpower system powered by an overshot wheel developed in the Village’s earliest years. This building illustrates not only the separate nature of work carried out by the Brethren and the Sisters, but also the Shaker philosophy of “Hands to Work and Hearts to God.” <p>The Laundry/Machine Shop may have begun as a dwelling dating to the 1790s, later adapted to a large utilitarian building positioned over the penstock, or incoming water supply pipe, from the reservoir. The post-and-beam structure is generally clad in clapboard like most building in the Village, with a stone foundation and wooden roof shingles.</p><p><i>Pittsfield, Berkshire County, Massachusetts.</i></p>
