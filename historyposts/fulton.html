                                    <p><span class="image left"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lmp2055/finalimages/master/images/fulton1.png" alt="" /></span>We visited the birthplace of Robert Fulton, an American Engineer and inventor widely credited with developing the steamboat. The Fulton family moved to the city of Lancaster about 1772. For nearly two centuries after the Fultons moved back to Lancaster, the house was owned and occupied by several generations of the Swift family. Here during the last half of the 19th century, a small commercial hamlet grew up along the line of the Peach Bottom Railway, later the Lancaster, Oxford and Southern Railroad, which ran through the Swift farm. Known as "Fulton House", this tiny cluster of buildings consisted of tobacco and grain warehouses, a store and post office, all operated by members of the Swift family.</p>
                                    <p>Fulton nurtured his early artistic talents by painting tavern and shopkeeper signs, as well as etching and engraving firearms for Isch and Messersmith Gunsmiths. Since Lancaster became a supply center for the Continental Army, American soldiers were a constant presence (as guards for British and Hessian prisoners of war), and this closeness to muskets and cannons laid the foundation for Fulton’s later interest with the weapons of war and instruments of explosion.</p>
                                    <p>Following his treatment at Berkley Springs, Fulton returned to Philadelphia and opened his own miniature-painting and hair-working shop on the west side of Front Street, near the Delaware River. According to biographer Cadwallader Colden, a friend and Fulton’s lawyer for a number of years, it was at the Berkeley Springs spa that Fulton was advised by “some gentlemen” to go to England to study painting with more celebrated artists than Philadelphia could offer. Fulton decided in the summer of 1787, during the Constitutional Convention, to sail for Europe to study art. Fulton left for London with a letter of introduction to the American painter Benjamin West, who had established himself as a founding member of London’s Royal Academy of Arts. Family tradition says the letter of introduction was written by Benjamin Franklin, who would have known West from his earlier travels in England. West helped Fulton find lodgings in London and took him on as a student. Unfortunately, not one of Fulton’s paintings from this period survives.<span class="image right"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lmp2055/finalimages/master/images/fulton2.png" alt="" /></span></p>
                                    <p>Fulton’s first foray into the world of inventions was the design for a marble-cutting machine, a model of which won him a medal by the Royal Society for the Encouragement of Arts, Manufacturers and Commerce. His London friendships with the Duke of Bridgewater, who built his own canal, and the Earl of Stanhope, a great experimenter, inspired Fulton to abandon art for civil engineering, between 1792 and 1794. Sometime around 1794, Fulton sought his fortune planning a small system of canals to transport goods inland, and designing machines for cutting marble and spinning flax with a powered loom. Fulton also fostered his interest in steam propulsion with a boat in a correspondence with Lord Stanhope.</p>
                                    <p>In the spring of 1787, during a lull in the hostilities between England and France, Fulton journeyed to Paris to seek his fortune with his canal schemes. Fulton became close friends with the American poet and businessman Joel Barlow and his wife Ruth. These Paris years—coinciding with Napoleon’s emergence as a great military leader—were extremely influential on Fulton’s future career. His career focus shifted from painting and canal design to the steamboat and steam navigation. Fulton designed a submarine, the Nautilus, which he tried to sell to Napoleon.</p>
                                    <p>As for the development of the steamboat, for which Fulton ultimately became famous, there were literally dozens of precedents for the boats he had built in Paris and tested on the Seine River. Fulton achieved his future success with steamboats by becoming acquainted with British, French and American promoters of industrialism. By 1801, Fulton had befriended the American minister to France, Robert R. Livingston from New York State. Livingston was also interested in steamboats and laid much of the groundwork from the Boulton and Watt steam engine company to study the feasibility of making a steam engine which might be used to power a boat. Fulton, with the backing of both Livingston and Barlow, succeeded in bringing a Boulton and Watt engine to New York in December 1806 and began constructing the hull for his pioneer steamboat trials on the Hudson River using the Clermont.</p>
                                    <p>In January 1808, Fulton married Harriet Livingston and became a family man: by the time of his death in 1815, Fulton had four children. He continued to build new boats - 21 in all – and the success of the steamboat very rapidly began to transform America. Fulton’s steamboat became the most important form of transport before the arrival of the railways and a great symbol of American industrial progress and wealth. Fulton’s steamboats were also transformed into military machines, which went against a central ambition of his life. However, there were few places in America that Fulton’s steamboat did not transform commercial processes, social customs, the patterns of migration and growth, and the speed of travel and communication. The technical skills and artistry of Robert Fulton’s steamboat demonstrated a great triumph of human technology over nature.</p>
