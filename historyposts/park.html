                           <h3>George Zeisloff Log Cabin, c. 1740</h3>
                                    <p><span class="image left"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lmp2055/finalimages/master/images/parkbarn1.jpg" alt="" /></span>Did you know there is a Pennsylvania Log House Society  that has been studying and working to preserve Pennsylvania German log structures since 1975? The organization has helped save many of these iconic and important buildings throughout the state, many of which are private homes.</p>

                                    <p>A block-house was erected in 1756 at present day Lynnport, Pennsylvania called Fort Everett. The fort acted as a place of refuge and defense during the Seven Years War. The site was used to guard the area just south of the Blue Mountain between the Schuylkill and Lehigh Rivers.</p>
                                    
                                    <p><i>"The 5-plate cast iron stove placed in this restoration is a 1747 replica of the stove used in the Henry Melchior Muhlenberg House in Trappe (Collegeville). When visiting, note the Biblical reference in German on the side plate of the stove from Luke, 9:62, which reads: 'And Jesus said to him, No man, having put his hand to the plough, and looking back, is fit for the kingdom of God.'</i></p>
                                    <p><i>The cabin has small windows, and the sleeping arrangements had the younger family members in the attic, while the older family members slept in the Kammer, which is the bedroom on the first floor. In line with Pennsylvania Dutch beliefs, this chamber includes a ventilator window that could be used as a Salen Fenster (though not originally part of the house, it was added after the re-build and move to the site), where should the person sleeping in the room die, the family would open the small soul window in order that the departed person's soul would go to heaven, a Rhineland tradition of the 17th and 18th century Pennsilfaanisch Deitsch still observe today".</i> <br />—Lynn-Heidelberg Historical Society</p>
                                    
                                    <p><i><span class="image right"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lmp2055/finalimages/master/images/parkbarn3.jpg" alt="" /></span>"The Zeisloff Log Cabin, in its final location at Ontelaunee Park, was added to the Lehigh County Log Cabin Trail Field Guide. They noted that the original fireplace lintel is used in the restored house. It is one log measuring 12 feet long and about 16 by 16 inches square. Many original stones also are used in the fireplace and the building's foundation. The fireplace is located in the center of the house, typical of a German log cabin. There is an opening in the rear of the fireplace to pass hot coals from the "kich," PA Dutch for kitchen, to the 5-plate cast iron stove in the living room, or "schtupp," for heating".</i><br /> —Lynn-Heidelberg Historical Society</p><br />
                                    
                                    
                            <h3>Pennsylvania Bank Barn</h3>
                                    <p><span class="image left"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lmp2055/finalimages/master/images/parktobacco1.jpg" alt="" /></span>A Mail Pouch Tobacco barn, or simply Mail Pouch barn, is a barn with one or more sides painted with a barn advertisement for the West Virginia Mail Pouch chewing tobacco company (Bloch Brothers Tobacco Company). The program ran from 1891 to 1992, and at its height in the early 1960s, about 20,000 Mail Pouch barns were spread across 22 states.</p><br />

                            <h3>Fort Everett (Reconstruction)</h3>
								    <p><span class="image right"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lmp2055/finalimages/master/images/parktobacco2.jpg" alt="" /></span>In 1838 construction on a new and larger Court House on a new site was begun, and the old Court House was demolished in 1841. The York County Bicentennial Commission reconstructed the old Court House in time for the 1977-78 celebration of the 200th Anniversary of the meeting of the Congress in York.</p>

                                    <p>It was while the Congress was at York that it passed the Articles of Confederation, although they were not to become effective until ratified by the various states. It was also while the Congress was at York that a treaty of Alliance was signed on February 6, 1778, with the French. Three months later a committee of the Congress began to prepare instructions to American commissioners at foreign courts.
