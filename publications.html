On an Oxford bound train in 1866 Mary Miles refused to move to the 'blacks-only' section, eighty-nine years before Rosa Parks' famous ride. Eight years later in a West Chester courtroom photographic evidence was used for the first time. Soon after that the hills of Westtown became the testing grounds for the Flexible Flyer, America's original steerable sled. These are among the extraordinary stories too often lost to Chester County's history (Amazon description) <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Hidden-History-Chester-County-Brandywine/dp/1609490738?ie=UTF8&%2AVersion%2A=1&%2Aentries%2A=0">Purchase</a></td>

Boudreai (ed.) and Margaretta M. Lovell (ed.). In this volume, scholars from various disciplines show how physical objects can expand our comprehension of how people lived, worked, and thought during the colonial and early national periods. In reading objects, they uncover complex economic, ethical, and mnemonic issues; investigate the political life of seemingly unpolitical things such as a rock in Plymouth, Massachusetts; and consider the environmental riches and extraction industries behind early American prosperity and ingenuity (Amazon description). <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Material-World-Culture-Society-Anglo-America/dp/0271081155?ie=UTF8&%2AVersion%2A=1&%2Aentries%2A=0">Purchase</a> </td>

Alexander introduces readers to the history of the Georgian shoe. Presenting a series of stories that reveal how shoes were made, sold, and worn during the long eighteenth century, Alexander traces the fortunes and misfortunes of wearers as their footwear was altered to accommodate poor health, flagging finances, and changing styles. She explores the lives and letters of clever apprentices, skilled cordwainers, wealthy merchants, and elegant brides, taking readers on a colorful journey from bustling London streets into ship cargo holds, New England shops, and, ultimately, to the homes of eager consumers (Amazon description). <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/142142584X/?coliid=I2PNVLUIV529T0&colid=JAYNQLCYS1JB&psc=1&ref_=lv_vv_lig_dp_it_im">Purchase </a></td>

				                <td class="pubtextalign"><strong>The Primary Structures of Fabrics: An Illustrated Classification</strong><br />By Irene Emery. Based on years of study of a huge range of fabrics produced by hand or by strictly limited mechanization, its essential strength is its universality. In this monumental work, the structures and the descriptive terms applied to them are clearly presented according to their logical relationships to each other, moving from the simplest to the most complex. The book is divided into three parts: the raw materials of fabric structures (filaments and fabric elements); the fabric structure themselves, whether felted or made from interworked yarns; and structures such as stitches or appliquÃ© (Amazon description). <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/050028802X/?coliid=I350VA4TUG3L88&colid=JAYNQLCYS1JB&psc=1&ref_=lv_vv_lig_dp_it_im">Purchase </a></td>

In the 18th century, Newport, Rhode Island, was home to some of the most skillful craftsmen in colonial North America. Among them were the clockmakers William Claggett (1694â€“1748), James Wady (d. 1759), and Thomas Claggett (1730â€“1797)â€”individuals whose surviving works became the best-known records of their lives. Although they flourished in an era widely considered as a golden age of prosperity in Newport, their stories remained elusive, with a few magnificent clocks the only testament to their place in pre-Revolutionary New England.

Trenton between 1774 and 1783 is a microcosm of the challenges faced by ordinary Americans during the revolution, struggles intensified by Trentonâ€™s geographic location in the state which saw more military activity than others and on a road constantly user to move and supply armies. Life in Trenton connected to just about every aspect of the revolution. The story of the people who lived in Trenton, or who spent time there because of the revolution, helps us better understand the hitherto untold importance of their town beyond the one well known day of battle (Amazon description). <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/0998059315?ref_=pe_603880_38310380">Purchase</a></td>

For the first time in military history, the camera was there to record these seismic events, from innovations in military and naval warfare, to the battles themselves; from commanders at critical moments in the battle, to the ordinary soldier tentatively posing for his first ever portrait on the eve of battle. It reveals not only how the first photographers plied their trade, but also how photography helped shape the outcome of the war and how it was reported to anxious families across the North and South (Amazon description). <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/1472822765?ref_=pe_603880_38310380">Purchase</a></td>

Some one has compared the old roads out of Phila delphia to the sticks of a lady's fan. If an opened fan is laid on the map of Philadelphia and its surrounding country westward, the boundary sticks may be made to conform to the Delaware. The city itself will be covered by the open portion of the fan, while the radi ating sticks will correspond after a fashion to the ten great old roads, several of which date from the later years of the seventeenth century (Amazon description). <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/1332866123?ref_=pe_603880_38310380">Purchase</a></td>
